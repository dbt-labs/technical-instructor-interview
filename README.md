Welcome to your new dbt project!

### Using the project

Try running the following commands:
- dbt run

### Instructor directions
- in our flagship course, dbt Fundamentals, we build out a jaffle_shop project including staging models, sources, and a dim table.
- this project is complete through the lessons of data modeling and sources.
- testing is the next topic and your goal is to run a lesson starting off with testing.
- leverage learner knowledge given that they would have already learned about models and sources.
